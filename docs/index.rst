Linux Information
-----------------

Once upon a time, before Linux there were some Operating Systems. This was known as a dark age of server operating systems.
Now there is Linux. 

This documentation demo doesn't do or achieve much, except for illustrating how documentation could look. 

Please fasten seatbeats, and enjoy the ride.
